# Types of Iconography
Motif: Has no symmetry
Frize: 1D Symmetry (infinite),
Tile: 2D symmetry
Ensemble: composition of motiffs. 

Symmetries are considered planar and without rotations.

# 1. Tracing the SVG
Trace it, add it to a canavas of 248 by 248, at least two sides touching the edges.

1. Motif -> has no symmetry.
3. If it is a frize add only the repeatable motif, no symmetry or rotation necessary.(example).
4. If it is a tile add only tileable motiff.

# 2. Cleaning the SVG.
